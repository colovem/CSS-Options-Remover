# CSS-Options-Remover
CSS Options Remover is a simple GUI tool that allows users to remove unwanted CSS options from their stylesheets. The program reads in a CSS file, parses it to extract all available CSS options, and displays them in a treeview widget. The user can then select the options they wish to remove and click the "Remove" button to generate a new stylesheet with the selected options removed.

This tool was built using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI, and cssutils to parse and modify CSS files. The program can be easily installed using pip and can be run from the command line or as an executable.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. It is released under the MIT license, meaning it is free to use, modify, and distribute. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a good starting point for beginners looking to learn more about Python GUI programming and working with CSS files.
